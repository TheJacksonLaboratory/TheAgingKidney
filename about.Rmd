The work contained here has been collaboratively conducted by the [Korstanje Lab (The Jackson Laboratory)](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-korstanje-lab), [Churchill Lab (The Jackson Laboratory)](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-churchill-lab), and the [Gygi Lab (Harvard Medical School)](https://gygi.med.harvard.edu/) as a initiative driven by [The Jackson Aging Center](http://agingmice.jax.org/).

We used the [Diversity Outbred](https://www.jax.org/strain/009376) mice, a powerful genetic resource for high resolution mapping, to model both transcriptomic and proteomic changes that occur during renal aging in a genetically diverse population.

This online resource provides [source code](https://github.com/ytakemon/TheAgingKidney) used to [generate our results](https://ytakemon.github.io/TheAgingKidney/analysis.html) that appear in our [publication].
